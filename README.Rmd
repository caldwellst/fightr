# fightr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of fightr is to enable quick and reproducible wrangling and analysis of
data in the Fight for Peace database.

## Installation

You can install fightr from [CRAN](https://github.com/caldwellst/fightr) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("caldwellst/fightr")
```

## Database parsing

Currently, you can parse the database Excel output only, but more to come. 

``` r
library(fightr)

parse_ffp_database("filepath.xlsx")
```
